This script will update symlinks specified inside it to the latest ssl certificates from the relevant accounts on the server.
Designed for use with cPanel's AutoSSL. This was created to combat Nginx requiring a direct link to the SSL Certificate while in use as a reverse proxy for Varnish Caching.

Currently Configuration is entirely manual inside the python script file.
